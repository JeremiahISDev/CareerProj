    <h2 className="card-title">1. Knowledge of the full stack</h2>
    <p>To stand out in such a market, being a full-stack programmer helps. If that makes you worry that you are expected to know every single programming language in the world, don’t fret. Full-stack doesn’t mean "everything." It simply means "end-to-end."


A software product is made of several layers—front-end, back-end, server, hardware, network, and database. An excellent software engineer would not only be knowledgeable about the functionality of each stack, they would also have the ability to jump in and independently solve problems in any phase of application development when needed.


This is important because a software engineer’s job is not to make code work in isolation, but to make the software work on the whole.
